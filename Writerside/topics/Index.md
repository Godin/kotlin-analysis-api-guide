# Analysis API

The Analysis API is a powerful library for analyzing code in Kotlin. Built on top of the Kotlin PSI syntax tree,
it provides access to various semantic information, including reference targets, expression types, declaration scopes,
diagnostics, and more.

While the Analysis API uses the Kotlin compiler internally, the API layer itself does not expose any compiler internals.
The library offers both source and binary backward compatibility for its stable parts.

The Analysis API encapsulates all challenging parts needed for efficient Kotlin code analysis, including lazy resolution
and cache invalidation, so you can focus on the actual code handling logic.

## Quick example

The `hasStringType()` function below checks if the given expression has a non-null `kotlin.String` type.

```Kotlin
@RequiresReadLock
fun KtExpression.hasStringType(): Boolean {
    analyze(this) {
        return expressionType == builtinTypes.string
    }
}
```

Most of the Analysis API surface can be accessed from inside `analyze {}` blocks. Such is the `expressionType` extension
property â€“ for the given `KtExpression`, it returns the resolved type.

`builtinTypes` is also a part of the Analysis API available inside the analysis block. It provides access to basic
Kotlin types, including number types, `Any`, `Nothing`, and `String`.

The type of `builtinTypes.string` is a `KaType`. `Ka` is a common prefix for all Analysis API components and
abstractions; it means "Kotlin Analysis API". Instances of classes with the `Ka` prefix often require special handling.
Check the [KaLifetimeOwner](Fundamentals.md#kalifetimeowner) section for more information.

## Using in IntelliJ IDEA

The Analysis API is not just some external API. It serves as the foundation for many features within the Kotlin plugin
for IntelliJ IDEA, including code completion, navigation across declarations, refactorings, inspections, the debugger,
and many more. By using the Analysis API, you get the same tools as the developers of the Kotlin plugin itself.

<emphasis>
The Analysis API has been available since IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2.

The API mainly targets the K2 Kotlin compiler, but there is also limited support for the legacy 1.0 compiler.
The same piece of logic implemented on top of the Analysis API, works both in the K1 and K2 Kotlin modes.

## Using in command-line tools

The Analysis API can also be used in command-line tools that perform Kotlin code analysis, including linters,
documentation generators, and code-generating utilities.

<note>
    Currently, the only officially supported use-case is IntelliJ IDEA plugin development.
    While the Analysis API provides the Standalone mode for command-line tool developers, it is currently in development
    and subject to incompatible changes.
